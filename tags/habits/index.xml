I don&amp;rsquo;t have any analytics tool in this blog, so you could be two or two hundred (I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards the first one, but why not dream with the latter?). Starting today I have decided to post a new blog every two weeks (so every other Friday). Why? Because if I don&amp;rsquo;t try to build a habit around this, I will just procrastinate a lot about it. That means there will be posts with fewer words and less preparation, but also, I think I will get better with practice.</description></item></channel></rss>
