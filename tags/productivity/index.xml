I finished the blog with the mix of GTD and MIT (Most Important Task) method setup that I had for a while. It was a bit painful to update the three most important tasks for each context each time I completed a task. So, I decided to stop doing it.</description></item><item><title>My Productivity Story - Part 1</title><link>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/productivity-story-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/productivity-story-part-1/</guid><description>So I decided that I want to share my entire productivity system here in my blog. But my system is a mix of a lot of stuff I have learned since I was in the university. So I will try to tell that story from the start and all the things I have found since then.
Everything started one afternoon when I had a lot of things to do for the university, and had no idea where to start.</description></item><item><title>New schedule for blog posts</title><link>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/new-schedule/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/new-schedule/</guid><description>Hi, dear readers! I don&amp;rsquo;t have any analytics tool in this blog, so you could be two or two hundred (I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards the first one, but why not dream with the latter?). Starting today I have decided to post a new blog every two weeks (so every other Friday). Why? Because if I don&amp;rsquo;t try to build a habit around this, I will just procrastinate a lot about it. That means there will be posts with fewer words and less preparation, but also, I think I will get better with practice.</description></item><item><title>My way of doing pomodoros</title><link>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/pomodoros/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubernesto.github.io/posts/pomodoros/</guid><description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about The Pomodoro Technique and know some Italian. In that case, you may wonder: &amp;ldquo;Is this a cooking blog?&amp;rdquo;. But no, I will not talk about the tasty tomatoes (Pomodoro in Italian) today. I will speak of a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo that consists of having deep focus sessions of approximately 25 minutes and a break of 5 minutes. Also, every 4 sessions, a more extended break of 15 minutes.</description></item></channel></rss>
