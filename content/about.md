# Welcome

Hi all! And welcome to my blog. My name is Ernesto Gonz√°lez and I am an AppDev Consultant for Red Hat, where my jobs is to help customers deploy their applications on top of OpenShift. I also enjoy developing video games and had worked in Pod Escape, a video game deployed on top of OpenShift for the Red Hat Summit of 2020. You can find it here: https://arcade.redhat.com.
